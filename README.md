> The UEFA Champions League is UEFA's elite club competition with top clubs across the continent playing for the right to be crowned European champions.

> The tournament, then called the **European Cup**, began in *1955* with 16 sides taking part. It changed into the **Champions League** in *1992* and has expanded over the years with a total of 79 clubs entering in *2019*. 

> Qualifying begins in the summer with three rounds and then a play-off taking place before 32 teams begin the group stage starting in September. 

> The group stage involves eight groups of four teams, with each club playing everyone else in that group home and away. The top two sides in each group move on to the round of 16 and the start of the knockout phase, while the third-placed team drops into the **UEFA Europa League**.

> The round of 16, quarter-finals and semi-finals are played over two legs, home and away, while the final is hosted by a stadium which is selected almost two years in advance.

## Some History

> There have been three **Premier League** winners of the **UEFA Champions League** since it was formed, **Manchester United** (twice in *1998 and 2007*), **Liverpool** *(2004 and 2018)* and **Chelsea** *(2011)*.

> Those five wins have produced plenty of drama. United staged an astonishing comeback with two goals in two stoppage-time minutes to defeat **Bayern Munich** 2-1 in 1999 while in *2005*, **Liverpool** fought back from 3-0 down at half-time against **AC Milan** to force extra-time before winning the contest on penalties, the final being known as the **Miracle of Istanbul.** 

> **United** then beat **Chelsea** on penalties in *2008* in the first European Cup final to be played between two English teams but the Blues became the first London side to win the Champions League trophy four years later when they defeated **Bayern Munich** on penalties in **Munich.**

## Top 3 Most Anticipated players to watch this year(my opinion)
* João Félix

When Atletico Madrid announced the departure of Griezmann, there was not much optimism in terms of replacing the Frenchman. Simeone though has provided a masterstroke of business by securing Félix. The young Portuguese was one of the highly sought after footballers after a sensational season with Benfica. A player good with both feet and his head, Félix tore up the Portuguese first division. He scored 15 goals and laid 7 assists to guide Benfica to the Primeira Liga title. He also won the best young player in the league for his feats. Eager to prove himself in the biggest stage, João Félix is expected to deliver the goods for the Colchoneros.
* Eden Hazard

Hazard has finally secured his dream move to Real Madrid, one that has materialized after four years of anticipation. The Belgian has arrived at the Bernabeu with immense pressure on his shoulders, as Los Blancos are just off the back of their worst season in decades. He is expected to produce from the get-go, with almost no time to settle in. Currently sidelined due to injury, Los Merengues need their marquee signing up on his feet as soon as possible to challenge in all fronts. For a club with a rich history in the competition, they are expected to be one of the front-runners and the Belgian could provide the X-factor.
* Kai Havertz

Havertz was the heart of the Bayer Leverkusen midfield last season, as he waltzed in 17 goals and guided them to the UCL. Playing just behind the strikers, the young German possesses a penchant for finding the back of the net. It has been three years since Leverkusen last played in the competition and they need the precocious teenager to be in his full flow to go past the group stage.
